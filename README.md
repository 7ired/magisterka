I. Introduction
Overview of the topic
1) A brief introduction to stock market stocks and trends - bull and bear market, what influences;
2) Limitations of current predictive models - reference to time series models that may not be able to capture the dynamics of price changes in the stock market;
3) Potential benefits of using Markov chains and neural networks to predict stock prices - the ability to capture non-linear relationships and adapt to a changing market environment;
Research questions
5) How can Markov chains be used to predict stock prices in the stock market?
6) How can neural networks be used to predict stock market prices?
7) How do the results of these different models compare with each other?
Research objectives
1) Investigate the effectiveness of Markov chains and neural networks in predicting stock prices;
2) Compare the prediction accuracy of these two models;
Scope and limitations
1) The research will be conducted on the S&P 500 stock market;
2) Adopt metrics for evaluating the accuracy of prediction;
3) Limitations due to the complexity of the models - overfitting, underfitting, selection of appropriate parameters;
